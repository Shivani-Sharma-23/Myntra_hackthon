## Themes Based Shopping Option
- Curation: Themes are curated collections of products that share common aesthetic or functional attributes (e.g., anime, minimalist, ethnic). They showcase products aligned with current trends or seasonal influences.
- Inspiration: By presenting products in thematic groupings, theme-based shopping inspires consumers with new ideas and combinations. This exposure can influence consumer preferences and style choices.
- Cross-Selling: Encourages customers to explore related items within a theme, potentially introducing them to new trends or complementary products they might not have considered.
